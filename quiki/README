Quiki Application for Chowdah
Released under the MIT/X license

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quiki is a sample application to demonstrate how to use the Chowdah library to
create websites. Quiki is a simple wiki that supports using Textile markup to
style pages. Additionally, it also features a simple user system, where users
must register in order to be able to edit pages.

Quiki is not meant to be a fully-featured wiki or database application, but to
show how resources are created and how to interact with HTTP using Chowdah.

Instructions:

 1) Unpack the contents of the quiki directory into the root of your
    application. (NOTE: this must be at the root of a domain name, aka,
    www.example.com/ and not www.example.com/some/sub/folder/)
 2) Rewrite all requests in the root folder to the .quiki/request.php file. On
    Apache servers, this can be done by creating an .htaccess file in the root
    folder and using mod_rewrite:
    
     # rewrite to request handler
     RewriteEngine On
     RewriteRule ^.* .quiki/request.php [E=REMOTE_USER:%{HTTP:Authorization}]
     
     # These may be needed on some servers
     # SecFilterEngine Off
     # DirectorySlash Off
 
 3) Navigate to the root folder using your web browser and run the installation.
    (You must have an available MySQL database and permissions in order to run
    Quiki).
    
Usage:

Once logged in, a user can create a page in the pages/ directory, edit any
existing page (including the main page), or delete pages. Users can register by
using the registration form, which will send a randomly-generated password to
the e-mail address supplied.
     
Information:

Quiki is a simple application that is meant to show the extensibility of the
Chowdah library. You are free to modify, redistribute, and copy it in any way in
