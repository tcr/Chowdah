--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quiki is a sample application to demonstrate how to use the Chowdah library to
create websites. Quiki is a simple wiki that supports using Textile markup to
style pages. Additionally, it also features a simple user system, where users
must register in order to be able to edit pages.

Quiki is not meant to be a fully-featured wiki or database application, but to
show how resources are created and how to interact with HTTP using Chowdah.

Requirements:

Quiki requires PHP 5, an available MySQL database, and an Apache server with
mod_rewrite (for other servers, please consult the Chowdah website).

Instructions:

 1) Unpack the contents of the quiki directory into the destination folder.
 2) Navigate to the folder using your web browser and follow the installation
    instructions.
 3) (Optional) If no styles are showing up, check that the mime_types path in
    .quiki/chowdah/config.ini is correct for your server.
    
Usage:

Once logged in, a user can create a page in the pages/ directory, edit any
existing page (including the main page), or delete pages. Users can register by
using the registration form, which will send a randomly-generated password to
the e-mail address supplied.
     
Information:

Quiki is a simple application that is meant to show the extensibility of the
Chowdah library. You are free to modify, redistribute, and copy it in any way in
