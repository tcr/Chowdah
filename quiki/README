Quiki Application for Chowdah
Released under the MIT/X license

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Quiki is a sample application to demonstrate how to use the Chowdah library to
create websites. Quiki is a simple wiki that supports using Textile markup to
style pages. Additionally, it also features a simple user system, where users
must register in order to be able to edit pages.

Quiki is not meant to be a fully-featured wiki or database application, but to
show how resources are created and how to interact with HTTP using Chowdah.

Instructions:

 1) Unpack the quiki directory into the root of your application.
 2) Rewrite all requests in the root folder to the .quiki/request.php file. On
    Apache servers, this can be done by creating an .htaccess file in the root
    folder and using mod_rewrite:
    
     # rewrite to request handler
     RewriteEngine On
     RewriteRule ^.* .quiki/request.php
 
 3) Navigate to the root folder using your web browser and run the installation.
    (You must have an available MySQL database and permissions in order to run
    Quiki).
    
Usage:

Once logged in, a user can create a page in the pages/ directory, edit any
existing page (including the main page), or delete pages. Users can register by
using the registration form, which will send a randomly-generated password to
the e-mail address supplied.
     
Information:

Quiki is a simple application that is meant to show the extensibility of the
Chowdah library. You are free to modify, redistribute, and copy it in any way in
