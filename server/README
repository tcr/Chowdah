--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Server application is a simple demonstration of how to emulate a normal
file server using Chowdah. It overlays the filesystem, and creates document
and collection objects of existing files. In addition, it allows finer control
of file metadata through the use of .metadata.ini files.

Instructions:

 1) Unpack the .server directory into the root of your application. (NOTE: this
    must be at the root of a domain name, aka, www.example.com/ and not
    www.example.com/some/sub/folder/)
 2) Rewrite all requests to the root folder to the .server/request.php file. On
    Apache servers, this can be done by creating an .htaccess file in the root
    folder and using mod_rewrite:
    
     # rewrite to request handler
     RewriteEngine On
     RewriteRule ^.* .server/request.php
 
 3) (Optional) Configure chowdah using the .server/chowdah/config.ini file, such
    as specifying the location of mime.types (if PHP cannot determinethe mime
    type of a file by any other means)
    
Usage:

The server will now be able to accept HTTP requests. For additional control over
your files, you can create a .metadata.ini file in the parent directory of each
document you want to extend. For example, if in an images/ folder there is a
file flowers.jpg, which you want to specify has a mime-type of image/jpeg, you
can create images/.metadata.ini with the following content:

     [flowers.jpg]
     content_type = image/jpeg

You can also set controls on how folders are displayed in its .metadata.ini. If
you would like to specify whether accessing a folder should show a directory
list, you can set the allow-directory-list option in the beginning of the file
(before any file settings):

     allow_directory_list = true

If you would instead like to show a document when the folder is accessed (such
as index.html), you can use the index setting:

     index = flowers.jpg
