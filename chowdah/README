 Chowdah | REST Framework for PHP5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chowdah is a framework for developing REST applications in PHP5. It contains a
library to manipulate HTTP requests and responses, create "resource" objects 
which can be manipulated via HTTP calls, and manipulate files, documents, and
collection objects.

Requirements:

Chowdah requires PHP 5, and an Apache server with mod_rewrite or any server with
URL-rewriting capabilities.

Usage:

To get started, extract the "chowdah" directory to where you want the Chowdah
library to be located (normally your application's script folder). Next, create
a request-handling script called "request.php" in your script folder that
initializes Chowdah. For example:

	<?php
	
	// load Chowdah class
	require 'chowdah/Chowdah.php';
	
	// import classes, init, &c...
	
	// load Chowdah
	Chowdah::init();
	Chowdah::handleCurrentRequest(new RootResource())->send();
	
	?>

Next, all requests to the root folder must be rewritten to the script. On Apache
servers, this can be done with the following .htaccess file in the root folder:

	# rewrite all requests to the handler
	<IfModule mod_rewrite.c>
	  RewriteEngine On
	  RewriteRule ^.* .application/request.php [E=REMOTE_USER:%{HTTP:Authorization}]
	</IfModule>
	
	# the following features are disabled to prevent them from modifying
	# URLs (Chowdah takes care of any potential security issues)
	<IfModule mod_security.c>
	  SecFilterEngine Off
	</IfModule>
	<IfModule mod_dir.c>
	  DirectorySlash Off
	</IfModule>

Where ".application/request.php" is the path of the request handler. For IIS or
other servers, you will need to find an alternative URL rewriting solution.

Configuration:

To have greater control over how Chowdah operates, you can create a "config.ini"
in your Chowdah directory. The following options are currently available:

  application_root (example: application_root = "..")
  
     By default, Chowdah assumes the root of your application is the parent
     folder of the request handler; this setting allows you to modify this
     behavior. This setting is important for resolving request URLs.

  request_log (example: request_log = "../request.log")
  
     This generates a log of each HTTP request made to a resource, the method
     used, and the time it takes to generate the resource.
     
  mime_types (example: mime_types = "/etc/mime.types")
  
     Points to the location of mime.types on the server. This is useful if you
     are loading static files from the server (using the FSDocument class), and
     when other MIME type detection methods aren't available.
     
  catch_errors = (true|false)
   
     If set to true, all errors are caught and displayed as a 500 Internal
     Server Error. Otherwise, unsuppressed errors are displayed as normal
     (potentially breaking HTTP headers).
     
  catch_exceptions = (true|false)
   
     If set to true, all exceptions are caught and displayed as a 500 Internal 
     Server Error. Otherwise, uncaught exceptions are displayed as normal
     (potentially breaking HTTP headers).
     
Applications:
     
To view sample applications, take a look at the Chowdah website:

Several applications are provided for free for you to examine, modify, and off
which, base your code.
