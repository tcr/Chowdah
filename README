 Chowdah | REST Framework for PHP5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chowdah is a framework for developing REST applications in PHP5. It contains a
library to manipulate HTTP requests and responses, create "resource" objects 
which can be manipulated via HTTP calls, and manipulate files, documents, and
collection objects.

To get started on an Apache server, extract the "source" directory to where you
want the Chowdah library to be located. To load an application, create an
.htaccess file rewriting all requests to the folder to the Chowdah handling
script. For example:

     # rewrite to Chowdah handler
     RewriteEngine On
     RewriteRule ^.* chowdah/chowdah.php?app=../application/path
     
The "../application/path" segment should point to the path of the application to
be run (relative to the chowdah folder). To view sample applications, take a
look at the "applications" folder of this archive.
