 Chowdah | REST Framework for PHP5
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Chowdah is a framework for developing REST applications in PHP5. It contains a
library to manipulate HTTP requests and responses, create "resource" objects 
which can be manipulated via HTTP calls, and manipulate files, documents, and
collection objects.

To get started on an Apache server, extract the "chowdah" directory to where you
want the Chowdah library to be located. In your application folder, create a
request-handling script akin to the following:

	<?php
	
	// load Chowdah class
	require 'chowdah/Chowdah.php';
	
	// import classes, init, &c...
	
	// load Chowdah
	Chowdah::init();
	Chowdah::handleCurrentRequest(new RootResource())->send();
	
	?>

Then in your root folder, create an .htaccess file rewriting all requests to the
request handling script. For example:

     # rewrite to request handler
     RewriteEngine On
     RewriteRule ^.* .application/request.php
     
To view sample applications, look in the "apps" folder of this archive. For more
